Okay, here's a Developer Manifesto focused on implementing Sagas in your PastryTycoon Orleans project, incorporating best practices for stream publishing.

# PastryTycoon Saga Implementation Manifesto

## 1. Introduction to Sagas

In PastryTycoon, a **Saga** is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data within a single service/grain and publishes a message or event to trigger the next transaction step. If a local transaction fails because it violates a business rule, the saga executes a series of **compensating transactions** that undo the changes that were made by the preceding local transactions.

We use Sagas to maintain data consistency across distributed grains (e.g., `OperationGrain`, `ActivityGrain`, `StepGrain`) without relying on distributed ACID transactions, which are often not feasible or scalable in microservice/grain-based architectures.

## 2. Core Principles of Saga Design

*   **Atomicity (Simulated):** The entire sequence of operations within a saga should appear atomic â€“ either all steps complete successfully, or completed steps are compensated for.
*   **Asynchronous & Event-Driven:** Sagas thrive on asynchronous communication via messages/events published to Orleans Streams.
*   **Idempotency:** Operations within saga steps and their compensations must be idempotent to handle message redelivery.
*   **Decoupling:** Grains participating in a saga should be decoupled from the saga orchestrator and each other, communicating primarily through events.
*   **Observability:** Sagas must be observable; their state, progress, and failures should be traceable.

## 3. Saga Implementation - Do's

*   **DO** clearly define each step of your saga and its corresponding compensating transaction *before* implementation.
*   **DO** use a dedicated **Saga Orchestrator Grain** (e.g., `OperationSagaOrchestratorGrain`) to manage the lifecycle of a saga instance. This grain is responsible for:
    *   Initiating saga steps by publishing command-like events.
    *   Tracking the state of the saga (e.g., which steps have completed).
    *   Listening for outcome/status events from participating grains.
    *   Initiating compensating transactions if a step fails.
*   **DO** persist the state of your Saga Orchestrator Grain (e.g., using `JournaledGrain` or standard grain persistence). This allows the saga to resume correctly if the orchestrator deactivates and reactivates.
*   **DO** use a unique **Correlation ID** for each saga instance. This ID should be included in all events and commands related to that saga instance, allowing for easy tracking and correlation of messages.
*   **DO** design all participating grain operations (steps and compensations) to be **idempotent**. If a command-event is processed multiple times, the outcome should be the same as if it were processed once.
*   **DO** implement **timeouts** in your Saga Orchestrator. If a response from a saga step isn't received within a reasonable timeframe, assume failure and trigger compensation.
*   **DO** ensure the Saga Orchestrator publishes a clear **final outcome event** (e.g., `SagaCompletedEvent`, `SagaFailedEvent`) indicating the success or failure of the entire saga.
*   **DO** break down large, complex business transactions into smaller, manageable saga steps.
*   **DO** log extensively within the Saga Orchestrator and participating grains, including the Correlation ID, to aid in debugging and tracing.

## 4. Saga Implementation - Don'ts

*   **DON'T** use long-running blocking calls within a saga step or in the Saga Orchestrator. Embrace asynchronicity.
*   **DON'T** make saga steps too granular (leading to excessive messaging and complexity) or too coarse (making compensation difficult and increasing the chance of failure within a large step).
*   **DON'T** forget to define and implement compensating transactions for every step that makes a data change. A saga without proper compensation is not a saga.
*   **DON'T** rely on synchronous, direct grain-to-grain calls for saga progression if it can be avoided. Prefer event-driven communication via streams.
*   **DON'T** neglect error handling within each step and in the Saga Orchestrator. Failures are expected; how you handle them defines the saga's robustness.
*   **DON'T** let the Saga Orchestrator become too "chatty" by requesting unnecessary status updates. Rely on events published by participants.

## 5. Publishing to Streams in Sagas - Best Practices

*   **DO** use **specific Stream Namespaces** for different semantic purposes. For example:
    *   `SagaStreamConstants.OperationSetupRequestsNamespace`: For initial requests from the API to the Saga Orchestrator.
    *   `SagaStreamConstants.OperationCommandsNamespace`: For command-like events from the Saga Orchestrator to `OperationGrain` instances.
    *   `SagaStreamConstants.ActivityCommandsNamespace`: For command-like events to `ActivityGrain` instances.
    *   `SagaStreamConstants.EntityStatusUpdatesNamespace`: For status events (success/failure) from entity grains back to the Saga Orchestrator.
    *   `SagaStreamConstants.SagaOutcomeNamespace`: For final saga completion/failure events from the Saga Orchestrator.
*   **DO** use the **target entity's ID as the `StreamId`** when the Saga Orchestrator publishes a command-like event to a specific entity grain (e.g., `OperationId` for `OperationCommandsNamespace`, `ActivityId` for `ActivityCommandsNamespace`). This enables targeted delivery and implicit subscriptions on the entity grains.
*   **DO** use the **`CorrelationId` of the saga instance as the `StreamId`** when entity grains publish status updates to the `EntityStatusUpdatesNamespace`. This allows the Saga Orchestrator to easily subscribe and filter for events related to the specific saga instance it's managing.
*   **DO** ensure events published to streams are **immutable** (C# records are excellent for this) and **self-contained** (they should carry all necessary data for the consumer to act).
*   **DO** use `[Alias("EventName.V1")]` on your event record definitions, especially if these events might be persisted by `JournaledGrain`s or if their schema is likely to evolve. This aids in versioning.
*   **DO** handle potential errors during stream publishing (e.g., `stream.OnNextAsync()`). Implement retry logic or fail the current saga step if publishing is critical and repeatedly fails.
*   **DON'T** publish overly large event payloads if it can be avoided. Send only necessary data.
*   **DON'T** use a single, generic stream namespace for all types of saga-related communication. This makes subscriptions and event handling complex and less type-safe.

## 6. Testing Sagas

*   **DO** write unit tests for the logic within the Saga Orchestrator (state transitions, command generation, compensation logic).
*   **DO** write unit tests for the individual participating grain handlers.
*   **DO** write integration tests that simulate the entire saga flow, including message passing via streams (using test stream providers) and potential failure/compensation scenarios.

## 7. Onboarding Checklist for Implementing Sagas

1.  Understand the business transaction you need to make consistent.
2.  Break it down into logical, sequential steps.
3.  For each step, define its operation and its compensating transaction.
4.  Identify the events that trigger each step and the events that signal completion/failure.
5.  Design your Saga Orchestrator Grain:
    *   How will it persist its state?
    *   How will it handle incoming requests and status updates?
    *   What streams will it publish to and subscribe from?
6.  Design your participating entity grains:
    *   How will they subscribe to command-like events (e.g., implicit subscriptions)?
    *   What status events will they publish?
    *   Ensure their operations are idempotent.
7.  Define all necessary DTOs, command-like events, and status events with appropriate `[GenerateSerializer]` and `[Alias]` attributes.
8.  Map out the stream namespaces and `StreamId` strategies.
9.  Implement and test thoroughly, especially failure and compensation paths.

By adhering to these principles and practices, we can build robust, scalable, and maintainable Sagas within the PastryTycoon Orleans application.

## 8. Practical Example: Crafting a Complex Recipe

Let's illustrate a saga with a common PastryTycoon scenario: crafting a "Deluxe Chocolate Cake" which requires two composite ingredients: "Rich Chocolate Ganache" and "Fluffy Sponge Layers". Both composite ingredients must be successfully crafted for the cake to be made. If crafting either ganache or sponge layers fails, the entire cake crafting process must fail, and any resources consumed for successfully crafted parts should be compensated (e.g., ingredients returned to inventory).

**Saga Participants:**

*   **`RecipeCraftingSagaOrchestratorGrain`**: Manages the overall cake crafting process.
*   **`CompositeIngredientCraftingGrain`**: A generic grain responsible for crafting composite ingredients like ganache or sponge layers. It might manage inventory for its specific ingredient.
*   **`PlayerInventoryGrain`**: (Potentially) involved in reserving/committing base ingredients.

**Saga Flow (Happy Path):**

1.  **Initiation:**
    *   Player requests to craft "Deluxe Chocolate Cake".
    *   API publishes `CraftRecipeRequestedEvent(CorrelationId, PlayerId, RecipeId="DeluxeCake", TargetCakeId)` to `SagaStreamConstants.RecipeCraftingRequestsNamespace`.
2.  **Saga Orchestrator (`RecipeCraftingSagaOrchestratorGrain` with `CorrelationId`):**
    *   Receives `CraftRecipeRequestedEvent`. Persists its initial state (e.g., `RecipeCraftingPending`).
    *   **Step 1: Craft Ganache.** Publishes `CraftCompositeIngredientCommandEvent(CorrelationId, IngredientId="Ganache", TargetCakeId, RequiredBaseIngredients)` to `SagaStreamConstants.CompositeIngredientCommandsNamespace` (StreamId = "Ganache").
3.  **`CompositeIngredientCraftingGrain` (for "Ganache"):**
    *   Implicitly subscribes, receives `CraftCompositeIngredientCommandEvent`.
    *   Attempts to reserve base ingredients (e.g., from `PlayerInventoryGrain` or its own state).
    *   If successful, crafts ganache, updates its state.
    *   Publishes `CompositeIngredientCraftedEvent(CorrelationId, IngredientId="Ganache", TargetCakeId)` to `SagaStreamConstants.EntityStatusUpdatesNamespace` (StreamId = `CorrelationId`).
4.  **Saga Orchestrator:**
    *   Receives `CompositeIngredientCraftedEvent` for "Ganache". Updates its state (e.g., `GanacheCrafted`).
    *   **Step 2: Craft Sponge Layers.** Publishes `CraftCompositeIngredientCommandEvent(CorrelationId, IngredientId="SpongeLayers", TargetCakeId, RequiredBaseIngredients)` to `SagaStreamConstants.CompositeIngredientCommandsNamespace` (StreamId = "SpongeLayers").
5.  **`CompositeIngredientCraftingGrain` (for "SpongeLayers"):**
    *   Implicitly subscribes, receives command.
    *   Crafts sponge layers.
    *   Publishes `CompositeIngredientCraftedEvent(CorrelationId, IngredientId="SpongeLayers", TargetCakeId)` to `SagaStreamConstants.EntityStatusUpdatesNamespace` (StreamId = `CorrelationId`).
6.  **Saga Orchestrator:**
    *   Receives `CompositeIngredientCraftedEvent` for "SpongeLayers". Updates its state (e.g., `SpongeLayersCrafted`).
    *   All steps successful. Assembles the "Deluxe Chocolate Cake" (conceptually, or by updating a `CakeEntityGrain` state).
    *   Publishes `RecipeCraftingCompletedEvent(CorrelationId, PlayerId, TargetCakeId, RecipeId="DeluxeCake")` to `SagaStreamConstants.SagaOutcomeNamespace` (StreamId = `CorrelationId`).

**Failure & Compensation Example (Sponge Layers Crafting Fails):**

*   ...Steps 1-3 complete successfully (Ganache is crafted).
*   **Saga Orchestrator** initiates Step 2 (Craft Sponge Layers).
*   **`CompositeIngredientCraftingGrain` (for "SpongeLayers"):**
    *   Fails to craft (e.g., insufficient base ingredients, validation error).
    *   Publishes `CompositeIngredientCraftingFailedEvent(CorrelationId, IngredientId="SpongeLayers", TargetCakeId, Reason="InsufficientCream")` to `SagaStreamConstants.EntityStatusUpdatesNamespace` (StreamId = `CorrelationId`).
*   **Saga Orchestrator:**
    *   Receives `CompositeIngredientCraftingFailedEvent`. Updates its state (e.g., `SpongeLayersFailed`, `SagaFailed`).
    *   **Initiate Compensation for Step 1 (Ganache):** Publishes `UndoCraftCompositeIngredientCommandEvent(CorrelationId, IngredientId="Ganache", TargetCakeId)` to `SagaStreamConstants.CompositeIngredientCommandsNamespace` (StreamId = "Ganache").
*   **`CompositeIngredientCraftingGrain` (for "Ganache"):**
    *   Receives `UndoCraftCompositeIngredientCommandEvent`.
    *   Reverts its state (e.g., marks ganache as not crafted, returns base ingredients to inventory).
    *   Publishes `CompositeIngredientCraftingUndoneEvent(CorrelationId, IngredientId="Ganache", TargetCakeId)` to `SagaStreamConstants.EntityStatusUpdatesNamespace` (StreamId = `CorrelationId`).
*   **Saga Orchestrator:**
    *   Receives `CompositeIngredientCraftingUndoneEvent`.
    *   All compensations complete.
    *   Publishes `RecipeCraftingFailedEvent(CorrelationId, PlayerId, RecipeId="DeluxeCake", Reason="SpongeLayersFailed: InsufficientCream")` to `SagaStreamConstants.SagaOutcomeNamespace` (StreamId = `CorrelationId`).

This example demonstrates how the saga orchestrator coordinates multiple steps, relies on events for communication, and handles failures by triggering compensating actions to maintain a consistent state.
